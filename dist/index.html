      <h1>The Blog Project</h1>
      <h2>Idea</h2>
      <p>
        The simple idea is to build and to help others to build a Blog with
        basic functionality. Because this idea is neither new nor especially
        exciting, the goal is to do it in a fully incremental setting. This
        project tries to preserve all subsequent iteration artifacts to aid the
        reader with every subsequent step. The basic project setup contains:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A versioning tool:
          <a href="https://github.com/julianiff/blog-project">github</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pipeline function that build the project on a tag and setups a
          subdomain with the artifact.
        </li>
        <li>
          A Documentation in the style of Blog articles that act as a
          <a href="#designdocs">design docs</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      To start of this blog series lets dig deeper into design docs. Where are
      they from, why are they important and how to use them.

      <p>
        Some time ago i was reading the interesting blog post
        <a
          href="https://www.industrialempathy.com/posts/design-docs-at-google/"
        >
          "Design Docs at Google"</a
        >
        from Malte Ubl. In there the author points out one of the key elements
        of Googles software engineering culture: to define software design
        through design docs. These design docs are informal and high level
        documents that show the strategies and key decisions with and emphasis
        on trade-offs. Besides a continuos documentation the design doc helps
        with:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Identify design issues while changes are cheap</li>
        <li>Share designs to get to a conses</li>
        <li>Were all Cross-Cutting concerns considered</li>
        <li>Share/Scale knowledge of Engineer</li>
        <li>Form a culture around design docs</li>
        <li>Gives the Software Engineer a technical portfolio</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Anatomy of a design Doc:</h2>
      A design doc should be written in whatever form is best suited for the
      project. It can consist of the following chapters:
      <ol>
        <li>Context and scope: Rough overview, bring the reader up to speed</li>
        <li>
          Goals and Non-goals: List of Goals and Non-Goals (Could be reasonable
          Goals but aren't)
        </li>
        <li>Actual Design:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Take the flexibility in expressing the problem</li>
          <li>Tell why the suggested solution satisfies the goals.</li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_context_diagram"
              >Context diagram</a
            >
            to show the boundaries between system
          </li>
          <li>Sketching the API / Data storage, stay precise not verbose</li>
          <li>Constrains on the solution, identify trade-offs</li>
          <li>
            Alternatives considered: Most important to argue for the chosen
            solution
          </li>
          <li>Cross-cutting concerns: Security, privacy and observability</li>
        </ul>
        <li>When to Avoid:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A design doc is not an implementation manual, there needs to be
            space for explanations about trade-offs, alternatives and decision
            making
          </li>
        </ul>
      </ol>

    <h2>Design Doc for the Blog "Time-X"</h2>

    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>
      The Blog Time-X has the Goal to demonstrate how to build a blog from scratch
      and the user should have the ability to see previous iteration easily. A goal is also to iteratively build the infrastructure 
      and have a high amount of automation to speed up the work. Again this automation should also be covered in the blog. A non-goal to start
      is to have all the common functionality a wordPress Blog site or Medium Blog site has. The focus at start is only on basic styling, automation 
      and letting the user experience the old iterations.
