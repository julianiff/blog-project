      <h1>1. The Blog Project</h1>
      <h2>Idea</h2>
      <p>
        The simple idea is to build and to help others to build a Blog with
        basic functionality. Because this idea is neither new nor especially
        exciting, the goal is to do it in a fully incremental setting. This
        project tries to preserve all subsequent iteration artifacts to aid the
        reader with every subsequent step. The basic project setup contains:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A versioning tool:
          <a href="https://github.com/julianiff/blog-project">github</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pipeline function that build the project on a tag and setups a
          subdomain with the artifact.
        </li>
        <li>
          A Documentation in the style of Blog articles that act as a
          <a href="#designdocs">design docs</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      To start of this blog series lets dig deeper into design docs. Where are
      they from, why are they important and how to use them.
      <h2 id="designdocs">Design Doc</h2>
      <p>
        Some time ago i was reading the interesting blog post
        <a
          href="https://www.industrialempathy.com/posts/design-docs-at-google/"
        >
          "Design Docs at Google"</a
        >
        from Malte Ubl. In there the author points out one of the key elements
        of Googles software engineering culture: to define software design
        through design docs. These design docs are informal and high level
        documents that show the strategies and key decisions with and emphasis
        on trade-offs. Besides a continuos documentation the design doc helps
        with:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Identify design issues while changes are cheap</li>
        <li>Share designs to get to a conses</li>
        <li>Were all Cross-Cutting concerns considered</li>
        <li>Share/Scale knowledge of Engineer</li>
        <li>Form a culture around design docs</li>
        <li>Gives the Software Engineer a technical portfolio</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Anatomy of a design Doc:</h2>
      A design doc should be written in whatever form is best suited for the
      project. It can consist of the following chapters:
      <ol>
        <li>Context and scope: Rough overview, bring the reader up to speed</li>
        <li>
          Goals and Non-goals: List of Goals and Non-Goals (Could be reasonable
          Goals but aren't)
        </li>
        <li>Actual Design:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Take the flexibility in expressing the problem</li>
          <li>Tell why the suggested solution satisfies the goals.</li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_context_diagram"
              >Context diagram</a
            >
            to show the boundaries between system
          </li>
          <li>Sketching the API / Data storage, stay precise not verbose</li>
          <li>Constrains on the solution, identify trade-offs</li>
          <li>
            Alternatives considered: Most important to argue for the chosen
            solution
          </li>
          <li>Cross-cutting concerns: Security, privacy and observability</li>
        </ul>
        <li>When to Avoid:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A design doc is not an implementation manual, there needs to be
            space for explanations about trade-offs, alternatives and decision
            making
          </li>
        </ul>
      </ol>

      <h1>2. Design Doc</h1>

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The Blog Time-X has the Goal to demonstrate how to build a blog from
        scratch and the user should have the ability to see previous iteration
        easily. A goal is also to iteratively build the infrastructure and have
        a high amount of automation to speed up the work. Again this automation
        should also be covered in the blog. A non-goal to start is to have all
        the common functionality a WordPress Blog site or Medium Blog site has.
        The focus at start is only on basic styling, automation and letting the
        user experience the old iterations.
      </p>

      <h2>Automation</h2>
      Trying to automate early to decrease the time from last commit to
      production, to have a lean and fast deployment process.
      <p>
        For the Automation the project uses
        <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions">Github Actions</a>. There
        exist many different CI/CD tools, for example CircleCI, Gitlab
        Pipelines, Azure DevOps and many more. Github has the advantage that it
        resides close to the source code and allows to version the pipeline with
        the other code.
      </p>
      <h3>Idea</h3>
      <p>
        On every push on the Master branch a github Action first builds the
        project and the deploys the project to the production environment.
      </p>
      <h3>Example</h3>
      A working example can be found under the github link with the version
      <a
        href="https://github.com/julianiff/blog-project/blob/v0.0.3/.github/workflows/upload.yml"
        >v0.0.3</a
      >.

      <h2>Frontend</h2>
      <h3>Components</h3>
      <p>The Frontend starts with 2 components:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>A Navigation to switch between the blog posts.</li>
        <li>
          A component where the Text of the Blog post will be. In early
          iterations images and other additions are a non-goal.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Styling</h3>
      <p>
        The components should be build in a way that they are highly reusable
        and decoupled. Therefore it is a goal to build components that provide
        styling interfaces that can be adjusted according to a respective theme.
      </p>

      <h3>Reuse of Components</h3>
      <h4>Increasing Software <a
        href="https://www.industrialempathy.com/posts/designing-even-larger-applications/#if-uncertainty-is-high-then-reduce-the-degree-of-abstraction."
      >Empathy</a>.</h4>
      <p>What is it in the existing infrastructure that users struggle with and how
      are they struggling with it? What is the class of applications that folks
      will build using your work in broad terms? What are the trends that
      influence the industry and how do those trends influence the software that
      folks are probably going to write in the future?
