<iff-title level="3">Reusable Components</hls-title>
<iff-text>At its core, a design system offers reusable components for consumer systems. A known mental model to guide the creation of design systems is the concept of atomic design. An atomic design has different layers of abstraction. The smallest abstraction is the atom. These are small design tokens or elements that are only useful when combined. </iff-text>
