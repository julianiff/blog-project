      <h1>The Blog Project</h1>
      <h2>Idea</h2>
      <p>
        The simple idea is to build and to help others to build a Blog with
        basic functionality. Because this idea is neither new nor especially
        exciting, the goal is to do it in a fully incremental setting. This
        project tries to preserve all subsequent iteration artifacts to aid the
        reader with the subsequent steps. To start off the project following
        configurations are given:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          As versioning tool
          <a href="https://github.com/julianiff/blog-project">github</a> is
          used.
        </li>
        <li>
          Every iteration gets a git-tag and sub-domain to preserve the
          artifact.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Blog entries to document the next iteration are held as
          <a href="#designdocs">design docs</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      To start of this blog series lets dig deeper into design docs. Where are
      they from, why are they important and how to use them.

      <p>
        Some time ago i was reading the interesting blog post
        <a
          href="https://www.industrialempathy.com/posts/design-docs-at-google/"
        >
          "Design Docs at Google"</a
        >
        from Malte Ubl. In there the author points out one of the key elements
        of Googles software engineering culture: to define software design
        through design docs. These design docs are informal and high level
        documents that show the strategies and key decisions with and emphasis
        on trade-offs. Besides a continuos documentation the design doc helps
        with:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Identify design issues while changes are cheap</li>
        <li>Share designs to get to a conses</li>
        <li>Were all Cross-Cutting concerns considiered</li>
        <li>Share/Scale knowledge of Engineer</li>
        <li>Form a culture around design docs</li>
        <li>Gives the Software Engineer a technical portfolio</li>
      </ul>
